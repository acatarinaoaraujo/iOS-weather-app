## Klimato 4 - iOS 4 Day Weather App :iphone: <img src="https://developer.apple.com/swift/images/swift-og.png" width="40">
This is a mobile application for iOS devices which allows users to see the forecast for any location on the globe. The app provides information about the weather for the next 4 days, and for each day, it gives the weather forecast on 4 different hours of the day. The forecast has data about the population, coordinates, weather, and temperature of the location. This was made possible by using the OpenWeather API, where the forecast is available in JSON and XML format.
<p>By working on this project I was able to learn how to use UIStackView, NSLayoutConstraint, UISwitch, UIScrollView, Delegation, CLLocationManager, perform a URL request, and parse JSON by using JSONDecoder. </p>

<p><b>Tools</b>: Xcode.</p>
<p><b>Languages</b>: Swift. </p>
<p><b>API</b>: OpenWeather. </p>
